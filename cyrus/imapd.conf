# Alternate namespace
# If enabled, activate the alternate namespace as documented in

# subfolders are in the same level as the INBOX
# See also userprefix and sharedprefix on imapd.conf(5)
altnamespace: yes

# UNIX Hierarchy Convention
# Set to yes, and cyrus will accept dots in names, and use the forward
# slash "/" to delimit levels of the hierarchy. This is done by converting
# internally all dots to "^", and all "/" to dots. So the "rabbit.holes"
# mailbox of user "helmer.fudd" is stored in "user.elmer^fud.rabbit^holes"
unixhierarchysep: yes

# Forcing recipient user to lowercase
# Cyrus IMAPD is case-sensitive.  If all your mail users are in lowercase, it is
# probably a very good idea to set lmtp_downcase_rcpt to true.  This is set by 
# default, per RFC2821. This was not set by default in debian versions up to
# and including 2.2.12-4.
lmtp_downcase_rcpt: yes
username_tolower: yes

# Uncomment the following and add the space-separated users who 
# have admin rights for all services.
admins: cyrus

# No anonymous logins
allowanonymouslogin: no

# Minimum time between POP mail fetches in minutes
popminpoll: 1

# If nonzero, normal users may create their own IMAP accounts by creating
# the mailbox INBOX.  The user's quota is set to the value if it is positive,
# otherwise the user has unlimited quota.
autocreatequota: -1

# umask used by Cyrus programs
umask: 077

# If enabled, cyrdeliver will look for Sieve scripts in user's home
# directories: ~user/.sieve.

# If enabled, the partitions will also be hashed, in addition to the hashing
# done on configuration directories. This is recommended if one partition has a
# very bushy mailbox tree.
hashimapspool: true

# Allow plaintext logins by default (SASL PLAIN)
allowplaintext: yes

# Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.
# Note that this command requires that the plaintext passwords are 
# available in a SASL auxprop backend (eg. sasldb), and that the system
# can provide enough entropy (eg. from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge
# in the banner.
allowapop: yes

# Enable virtual domain support.  If enabled, the user's domain will
# be determined by splitting a fully qualified userid at the last '@'
# or '%' symbol.  If the userid is unqualified, and the virtdomains
# option is set to "on", then the domain will be determined by doing
# a reverse lookup on the IP address of the incoming network
# interface, otherwise the user is assumed to be in the default
# domain (if set).
virtdomains: userid

# The default domain for virtual domain support
# If the domain of a user can't be taken from its login and it can't
# be determined by doing a reverse lookup on the interface IP, this
# domain is used.
defaultdomain: localhost
